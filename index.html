        <h1 class="about">About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am a passionate and driven software developer with a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science. My journey into technology began with a deep love for learning and problem-solving, which initially led me to a career in teaching. There, I developed the ability to break down complex concepts and collaborate effectivelyâ€”skills that continue to shape my approach to software development.
            
            Eager to expand my technical expertise, I transitioned into the world of programming through WeThinkCode_, where I immersed myself in hands-on projects and honed my analytical thinking. Through experiences like Robot Worlds and Code Clinics, I thrived in team-driven environments that emphasized collaboration, adaptability, and continuous learning. Working on these projects strengthened my ability to navigate agile methodologies, communicate effectively, and contribute meaningfully to team objectives.
            
            My technical acumen, combined with my passion for problem-solving and my commitment to professional growth, drives me to take on new challenges and continuously refine my skills. I am excited to apply my knowledge, work alongside innovative teams, and make meaningful contributions in the world of software development.
